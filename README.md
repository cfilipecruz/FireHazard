## 🚀 About the Project

The **Fire Extinguisher Management System** is a comprehensive web-based internal management platform designed for fire extinguisher maintenance companies. Developed as a part of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Graphics and Multimedia Engineering at ESTG/IPVC, this platform integrates seamlessly with the company's existing billing system, ftKode's GESFaturação, streamlining the management of fire extinguisher interventions, invoice generation, and reporting.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and password recovery.
- **Intervention Management**: Create, view, edit, and delete fire extinguisher interventions.
- **User Management**: Manage user roles and permissions.
- **Vehicle Management**: Track and manage intervention vehicles.
- **Fluid Type Management**: Manage types of fluids used in fire extinguishers.
- **Invoice Management**: Generate, view, edit, delete, and email invoices.
- **Data Filtering**: Advanced filtering options for efficient data retrieval.
